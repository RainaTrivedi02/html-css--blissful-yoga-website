# <u>Blissful Yoga Hub</u>

## Welocome to Blissful Yoga Hub:
Yoga is an ancient Indian practice that involves a holistic system of physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation to achieve a state of harmony between the mind and body. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to join," and the practice aims to bring the individual consciousness into union with the universal consciousness. Modern yoga often emphasizes the physical and mental health benefits, such as increased flexibility, strength, and stress relief.
